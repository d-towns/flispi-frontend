# Flint Proprerty Search

## Description
This is a simple web application that enables in depth search for the 10,000+ properties owned by the Land Bank of Genesee County in Flint, MI and surrounding cities. The application uses the API and web scraper built by myself here:
- [flispi-backend](https://github.com/d-towns/flispi-backend)
- [flispi-scraper]()

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the application using `npm start`  OR run using Docker with `docker-compose up`

## Why?
I built this application to help Flint residents and investors find properties that are owned by the Land Bank of Genesee County. The Land Bank is a public authority that owns over 10,000 properties in Flint and surrounding cities. The Land Bank is a great resource for Flint residents and investors, but it can be difficult to find properties that meet specific criteria. This application makes it easy to find properties that meet specific criteria, such as:
- Price
- Square footage
- Map location ( using Google Maps API )
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Zip code
- Neighborhood
- And more!
